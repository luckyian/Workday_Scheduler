# Workday Scheduler

In this Workday Scheduler project I added time blocks with a save button to an index.html page, created a javascript file with functions that listen for clicks on save buttons, displays the date at the top of the index.html, uses a 3rd party API to find the current time, and uses that information to color code time blocks on the index.html page.

Any input recieved in the text field is saved to local storage and persists over refresh.  Time-blocks change color as the time marches on.  Red for current time, green for future, and grey for past.  Formatting is identicial to given example.
